# Password Strength Analysis & Best Practices

---

## 1. Create Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity

To understand how password strength varies, I created different passwords:
- Simple: `password123`
- Medium: `Sunshine2024`
- Strong: `T!m3To$ecur3`
- Very Strong: `hP7#vdRk2W@`
- Weak (dictionary word): `ilovecats`
- Strong (symbols and mix): `R@inB0w_P@rk`

---

## 2. Use Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, Symbols, and Length Variations

Passwords include:
- Uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Lowercase letters (a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Symbols (!, @, #, $, etc.)
- Different lengths (from short to 12+ characters)

Mixing these factors increases password strength.

## 3. Test Each Password on Password Strength Checker

I used online tools such as:
- [passwordmonster.com](https://passwordmonster.com)
- [howsecureismypassword.net](https://howsecureismypassword.net)

These tools provide scores, estimated crack times, and suggestions.

## 4. Note Scores and Feedback from the Tool

| Password       | Strength Score | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback              |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| password123    | Very Weak      | < 1 second          | Too common            |
| Sunshine2024   | Weak           | Minutes             | Predictable pattern   |
| T!m3To$ecur3   | Strong         | Years               | Good use of variety   |
| hP7#vdRk2W@    | Very Strong    | Centuries           | Excellent randomness  |
| ilovecats      | Very Weak      | < 1 second          | Dictionary word       |
| R@inB0w_P@rk   | Strong         | Years               | Complex and unique    |

## 5. Identify Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

From testing, these best practices emerged:
- Avoid dictionary words and common patterns.
- Use a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Passwords longer than 12 characters are more secure.
- Use randomness instead of personal info.
- Employ password managers to store complex passwords.

## 6. Tips Learned from the Evaluation

- Do not reuse passwords across different sites.
- Update passwords regularly.
- Avoid predictable sequences (like "1234" or "abcd").
- Enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible.

## 7. Research Common Password Attacks

Here are common attack types beyond brute force and dictionary attacks:

- **Brute Force Attack:** Tries every possible character combination.
- **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a list of common words and passwords.
- **Phishing:** Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites or emails.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked username-password pairs from other sites.
- **Keylogging:** Malware records every keystroke to steal passwords.
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulates people into revealing passwords.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** Intercepts data being sent over unsecured networks.
- **Shoulder Surfing:** Observing someone entering their password.
- **Rainbow Table Attack:** Uses precomputed tables to reverse hashed passwords.
- **Password Spraying:** Tries common passwords against many accounts to avoid lockouts.

## 8. Summary: How Password Complexity Affects Security

Password complexity is vital for protecting digital accounts. Simple or common passwords can be cracked in seconds, while complex, long, and random passwords can take years or even centuries to break. The combination of character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and longer lengths significantly increases the time and resources needed by attackers. Regular updates and unique passwords for each account further enhance security. Awareness of attack types helps in creating safer online habits.
